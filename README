These scripts will automatically benchmark a test release of qshields with the previous tagged version

To run,
> ./benchmarkCheck.sh -q /path/to/qshields -g /path/to/g4cuore

If this is your first time running the script, you will also need to input your ROMA username to scp files at the beginning of operation.

note: This script uses a wait command, so you will need to kill other background processes while this script is running.

This will run for approximately 3 hours and perform the following:
1. Create output directories
2. SVN old data from ROMA cluster to local host. (~1.3 GB .tar file)
3. Generates spectra using same parameters as the old spectra (with fewer events) with the "new" qshields
4. Runs the "new" g4cuore on the new spectra with the same parameters as the old spectra


At the end of benchmarkCheck.sh, it will run:
> python benchmarkCheck_root.py

This will perform the following:
1. Create final output directories
2. Use plot_energy_template.cc to generate specific code to open the ROOT files from g4cuore
3. Runs the code on the ROOT files
4. The code generates comparison plots for benchmarking
5. Runs a simple check to determine if the total number of events has changed significantly
